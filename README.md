### Using ytinu

The easiest way is to install [ytinu](https://github.com/ytinu-mods/ytinu). It sets up everything for you and you can then install mods with one click. The ytinu page has instructions on how to install and use it.

### Manual installation

Download BepInEx version 5.4 from its [releases page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract it in your games installation directory. You should have a directory called `BepInEx` right next to the `MFT3.exe.exe`. See also [Installing BepInEx](https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).

Next, download any mods you want to use and place them in the `BepInEx/plugins` directory.

You can download the mods from the [releases page](https://github.com/benediktwerner/Desperados3Mods/releases) or using the links below.

To configure the mods you need to launch the game at least once after installing them. Then you can edit the configuration files in `BepInEx/config`.

Alternatively, you can install the [BepInEx.ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) (again by downloading the files and placing them inside the `BepInEx/plugins` directory). This allows you to bring up an in-game mod settings menu by pressing `F1`.
